# Inline photolysis preprocessor (inline_phot_preproc)

##  General Information

The utility creates two input files used by the in-line method for calculating photolysis rates. The CSQY_DATA\_*mechanism* file contains the 
cross-section and quantum yields for the photolysis rates used by the specified photochemical *mechanism*. The *mechanism* is determined the RXNS_DATA_MODULE.F90 from building and running the
 **chemmech** utility. The PHOT_OPTICS.dat file gives the optical properties for cloud water and ice plus the refractive indice for aerosol species. The file does not change between photochemical *mechanisms*.
When using the files for CCTM executions, the number of wavebands defined in the CSQY_DATA\_*mechanism* and PHOT_OPTICS.dat files need to be the same. The buildrun script sets this number.


##  Using the Utility.

The utility is built and executed for each application because the RXNS_DATA_MODULE.F90 file can change between applications. It is a FORTRAN program so a FORTRAN compiler is needed.  The bldrun script specifies what compiler to for running a Makefile configured for three options, the Intel (INTEL), Portland Group (PGF90), GCC gfortran (GFORT). If a user wishes to use not another option, the Makefile has to be modified.

To use the utility follow the below instructions.

1) Copy and edit scripts/bldrun.inline_phot_preproc.csh for your compiler and Mechanism. Save and run to build the software.

2) IF NEEDED, modify src/inline_phot_preproc.makefile based on the compilers and their flags on your computer platform.

3) If application uses photolysis rates whose cross-section and quantum yields are not listed under photolysis_CSQY_data, create the data files and add them to the directory.
 
4) Execute the script. Check the bldrun.log file if the executable does not produce CSQY_DATA table in the output directory.

## INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC

### Description

The program INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC generates absorption cross-section/quantum yield (CSQY) data files for the CCTM inline photolysis module. This utility program allows users to create new CSQY tables when reaction rate data are modified or added to CMAQ. The data tables generated by INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC should be used to create the photochemistry data tables needed for inline photolysis configurations of the CCTM.  

See [Chapter 9](CMAQ_OGD_ch09_grid_defn.md) for details on how to update existing mechanisms or create new mechanisms in CMAQ.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

To implement new CSQY data in CMAQ, start with individual CSQY data files for each photolysis reaction in an applicable photochemical mechanism. Add to or modify these data to create the CCTM inline CSQY data table.

The location of the INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC output files is set in the run script by the variable OUTDIR. To compile a version of the CMAQ programs that use the files created by INLINE_PHO_PREPROC, copy the output files to a new directory under the `$CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/src/MECHS/$Mechanism` directory. Point the CMAQ build scripts to this new directory with the “Mechanism” variable.
