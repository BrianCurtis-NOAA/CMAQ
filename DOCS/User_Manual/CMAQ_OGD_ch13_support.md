# CMAQ Support Resources #
** >>COMMENT<< ** This information should be greatly condensed and moved to one of the beginning sections so people realize these options are available for training and help on running CMAQ.  It does not need to be its own chapter. 


To support the CMAQ user community, EPA and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill host the [Community Modeling and Analysis System (CMAS) Center](http://www.cmascenter.org/), which distributes CMAQ software, develops cloud-based platforms for running CMAQ and analyzing outputs, and provides new user training on the CMAQ modeling system. The CMAS Center offers an e-mail help desk and an online forum to allow users to connect with model developers and other model users around the world. 


The following activities are available through the CMAS Center:

-   [Online help desk](https://www.cmascenter.org/help-desk.cfm) - Get help with the supported CMAS products
-   [Online user forum](https://forum.cmascenter.org) -  Post questions and search through previous posts for helpful tips
-   [Model clearinghouse](https://www.cmascenter.org/download.cfm) - Download the supported CMAS products
-   [Training courses](https://www.cmascenter.org/training.cfm) - Attend a training course on emissions modeling, air quality modeling, or other related topics
-   [Conferences](https://www.cmascenter.org/conference.cfm) - Attend the annual CMAS conference to interact with the community
-   [Data clearinghouse](https://www.cmascenter.org/download/data.cfm) - Access air quality modeling data from around the community
