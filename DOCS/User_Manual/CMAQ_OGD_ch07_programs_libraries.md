## Calmap

### Description

The preprocessor program Calmap produces gridded planting start dates, planting end dates, and harvesting end dates for different crop types for estimating the impacts of agricultural activities on windblown dust emissions. The CMAQ windblown dust emissions module can optionally use the output from Calmap to simulate the effects of crop cycles on dust emissions.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

** >> Comment <<** What's a "Spatial Allocator"?  What's this BEIS emissions model, and how is it different from SMOKE?

[Figure 7-3](Figure7-3) shows that Calmap reads five input files to produce eight outputs, only three of which are used by the CCTM. Calmap uses the GRIDCRO2D file, produced by MCIP, to define the modeling grid. The BELD01 file points to a BELD3 “a” file of gridded land cover/land use data containing coverage for several different crop categories. The BELD3 “a” file is an input to the BEIS emissions model and can be [generated by the Spatial Allocator](https://github.com/CMASCenter/Spatial-Allocator/blob/master/docs/User_Manual/SA_ch03_vector.md#5-creating-inputs-to-smoke-biogenic-processing). The rest of the inputs to Calmap are crop calendar data for the United States that are packaged with CMAQv5. Calmap converts to the data to I/O API GRDDED3 files on the modeling grid defined in the GRIDCRO2D file. The CROPMAP01 file contains planting start dates for specific crops. The CROPMAP04 file contains planting end dates for specific crops. The CROPMAP08 file contains harvesting end dates for specific crops. Each of these files are input to the CCTM when the erodible agricultural land (CTM_ERODE_AGLAND) feature is turned on.

** >> Comment <<** What if I'm outside the US?  Can I run CMAQ at all?  Can I run CMAQ with this option?  What's the workaround if I don't have Calmap input?  Can I "roll my own" datasets?  How would I do that?

#### Execution Configuration Variables ####

The environment variables listed here are invoked during execution of the program and are set in the Calmap run script.

```
-   BASE: [default: $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust/scripts] Base Calmap installation location.
-   GRID_CRO_2D: [default: none] Directory path and name of the GRID_CRO_2D file for defining the modeling grid.
-   BELD01: [default: none] Directory path and name of the BELD3 A file for defining the gridded land cover, land use in the modeling domain. Note that this is the same file used by the CCTM to compute dust emissions (DUST_LU_1).
-   CROPMAP01-08: [default: none] Directory path and names of Calmap output files. The CROPMAP01, CROPMAP04, and CROPMAP08 are the only files used by the CCTM for the dust calculation.
```

### Compiling and Running

#### Compile Calmap

Calmap is compiled with a Makefile. The configuration options in the Makefile include only the compiler and compiler flags to use for building the executable. The Makefile is located in the directory with the Calmap source code `$CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust/src`. To compile Calmap, source the config_cmaq.csh file and invoke the Makefile at the command line.

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust/src
source $CMAQ_HOME/config_cmaq.csh
./make |& tee make.calmap.log
```

To port Calmap to different compilers, change the compiler names, locations, and flags in the config.cmaq script.

#### Run Calmap ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run Calmap to produce crop calendar input for the CCTM inline windblown dust model:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust/scripts
./run_calmap.csh |& tee run_calmap.log
```

## CCTM

### Description

CCTM is the Eulerian chemistry and transport component of CMAQ. It uses input data produced by the other CMAQ programs and from meteorological and emissions models. CCTM produces multiple output files for each simulation. The basic CCTM outputs include instantaneous and average hourly concentration files, wet and dry deposition files, and visibility estimates. Other CCTM outputs can include diagnostic files and process analysis files.

CCTM contains several science configurations for simulating transport, chemistry, and deposition. All of the science configuration options in CCTM, such as the chemical mechanism to be used, are set when compiling the executable. The model grid and vertical layer structure for CCTM are set at execution. The important distinction between selecting the science configura­tion and the model grid, layer configuration is that CCTM does not need to be recompiled when changing model grids, layers but does need to be recompiled when new science options are invoked.

Optional output files are created when their associated processes are invoked in CCTM. For example, when CCTM is compiled with process analysis turned on, additional output files are created.

CCTM includes options for the in-line processing of emissions and photolysis rates. In-line refers to the handling of processes that had previously been accomplished outside of CCTM, such as emissions processing with SMOKE, with algorithms internal to CCTM. The benefits of in-line emissions processing include the integration of higher time-resolution meteorology in the computation of biogenic emissions and plume rise from point sources and the avoidance of the large data storage burden required for emissions data. The benefit of in-line photolysis rate calculations is the inclusion of predicted gas and aerosol concentrations in the rate calculations.

Both in-line emissions and photolysis are invoked through compile-time configuration options for CCTM. When CCTM is instrumented for in-line emissions calculations, a series of additional input files and environment variables are required at execution. The details of these additional inputs are provided below. In-line photolysis does not require any additional inputs as CCTM includes all of the photolysis rate data internal to the in-line instrumented version of the model.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

[Figure 7‑4](#Figure7-4) shows the input and output files and configuration options for CCTM. A distinction is made between the options that are invoked at compilation time versus those invoked at execution time. When compiling CCTM, the user specifies a chemical mechanism to configure the gas-phase chemistry and aerosol mechanism used for the air quality calculations. Setting the `Mechanism` variable in CCTM compile script configures the program to use a specific set of mechanism INCLUDE files to build an executable. All of the science processes simulated by CCTM must also be selected during the compilation step for CCTM. Separate CCTM executables must be prepared for different mechanism and science configurations. During the execution step, or when CCTM is run, the user sets the horizontal and vertical grid definitions and the input files used for the simulation. Different spatial domains, vertical grid structures and input files can be used with a single CCTM executable, as long as the input files are consistent with the scientific configuration built into the executable. For example, with the gas-phase photochemical mechanism configuration built into a CCTM executable, different modeling domains can be simulated with the executable as long as the emissions and `IC/BC` files are consistent with the photochemical mechanism configuration built into the executable.

#### Compilation Configuration Variables

The configuration options listed here are set during compilation of the CCTM executable. When these options are invoked they create a binary executable that is fixed to the specified configuration. To change these options you must recompile CCTM and create a new executable.

Several of the CCTM science modules have more than one option. Brief descriptions of these options are provided here. For details on the science of the different options refer to the [CMAQ Release Notes](../../CCTM/docs/Release_Notes/README.md).

The following five options are invoked by uncommenting the line in the CCTM build script.  Comment the line in the script using a "#" to turn the option off.

-   `CopySrc`  
    Uncomment to copy the source code into a working build (BLD) directory. If commented, only the compiled object and executable files will be placed in the BLD directory.

-   `set ParOpt`  
    Build an executable for running on multiple processors. Invoking this command requires the availability of the MPI library/INCLUDE files.

-   `MakeFileOnly`  
    Uncomment to build a Makefile to compile the executable. Comment out to both create a Makefile and compile.

-   `set build_parallel_io`  
     Uncomment to build CMAQ with true parallel I/O feature (requires ioapi3.2 and pnetcdf).

### Compiling and Running

#### Compile CCTM ####

[Chapter 5](CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md) provides an overview of how to install and compile the CMAQ pre-processor programs for a test simulation. Follow those steps (summarized below) to compile new versions of CCTM.

1. Compile Bldmake, the CMAQ source code and compilation management program. This needs to be done only once—the first time CMAQ is installed.
-   Configure the CCTM build script to use the config_cmaq.csh script, which points to the available `I/O API` and `netCDF` libraries.
-   Configure the CCTM build script for your application by setting the compilation configuration variables described above.
-   Invoke the build script to create an executable:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts
./bldit_cctm.csh [compiler] [version] |& tee build_cctm.log
```

#### Run CCTM ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run CCTM using the following command:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts
./run_cctm.csh |& tee run_cctm.log
```
